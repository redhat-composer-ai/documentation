## Red Hat Demo Environment

Composer AI is available as a catalog item for Red Hat employees and partners at demo.redhat.com:

[Composer AI Demo Environment](https://catalog.demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-composer-ai.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)

After requesting and provisioning the demo cluster, the environment will take some time to finish setting up in order to make all of the Assistants available.

Please refer to the [Environment Validation Instructions](documentation/demo/walkthrough#environment-validation-instructions) in the Demo Walkthrough to verify the completion of the automated setup.
